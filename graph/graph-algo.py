# Eulerian path 

# Given a directed graph. Construct another graph from a given graph such that if the path exists from vertices A to vertices B and from B to C, then the path from A to C and from C to A also should exist.


# dfs and bfs applications
# Used by search engines for web-crawling
# Used in artificial intelligence to build bots, for instance a chess bot
# Finding shortest path between two cities in a map and many other such applications

# Graph: Remove Edge
