# Top Algorithms And Data Structures You Need To Learn

With each Algorithm add

problem statement
input 
output 
Algo 
code 
Time and space complexity 
General cases, base cases, error cases
create common functions so that you can reuse that
every problem can be solved with recursion and without recursion
Can you solve this challenge in 4 lines of code or less?



firstly think and write logic
There is no point in seeing the solution directly
