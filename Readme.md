## Programming/Coding  problem Solutions / Problem Solving / White Board Coding
firstly think and write logic
There is no point in seeing the solution directly
problem solving - write comments, high-level pseudocode, a diagram, flowchart, more detailed sketches,
How to speak everything you are thinking
How to verify that your code works (and check that it handles unexpected inputs correctly)
How to break a problem into parts
How to relate a problem to other problems you've seen/solved
How to test a problem against various data structures to see if it can be solved more cleverly
How to scope a problem (define it, identify/question assumptions, determine inputs & outputs)
How to write a brute force solution
How to improve the efficiency of a solution
How to externalize your thoughts
How to comment code in a helpful and organized manner
How to trace through code to verify that it works for sample inputs
How to identify where in your code you made a mistake if you aren't getting the output you expect
How to test individual parts separately
How to identify patterns in problems by going through sample inputs and considering expected outputs.
Algorithm problem includes-
problem statement
input/output - General cases, base cases, error cases
Algorithm 
code 
Time and space complexity 
Every problem can be solved with recursion and without recursion
Can you solve this challenge in 4 lines of code or less?
How many approaches possible?
How to determine whether to use an iterative solution or a recursive solution
