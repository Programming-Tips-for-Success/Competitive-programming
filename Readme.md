# Top Algorithms And Data Structures You Need To Learn 

problem solving

With each Algorithm add

problem statement
input 
output 
Algorithm 
code 
Time and space complexity 
General cases, base cases, error cases
create common functions so that you can reuse that
every problem can be solved with recursion and without recursion
Can you solve this challenge in 4 lines of code or less?



firstly think and write logic
There is no point in seeing the solution directly

Learn to programme if you want to earn more. You can earn up to 50 lakh if you are good at coding. Here I will talk about popular websites on which you can sharpen your coding skills. These sites will help you to learn to programme better. There are various challenging tasks you will get which will help you to boost career growth.



To work in top companies as a software developer Competitive Programming is a must.



To check the most popular programming language check the below link-



ACM ICPC is called the Olympics of programming. Having an ACM ICPC rank in the regionals is a very added plus point.



To get offers from big companies you have to do it regularly. Try to rank higher, give contests, and build the rating. Learn C++, python, and java for competitive programming.



To be a Competitive programmer you have to be proficient in one language. Then you can participate in coding competitions.



The thing that matters is writing good code then you can earn and also algorithms solutions and data structure.  



In This Article I Will Talk About Some Algorithms That You Must Know If You Want To Crack Any Coding competition Test. It Will Also Help In Doing Dynamic/competitive Programming. These are the advanced methods/approaches to solve any problem in less time.

Competitive programming skills require that you are fast and able to think deeply about a problem. While learning these algorithms Check the complexity of each technique.
