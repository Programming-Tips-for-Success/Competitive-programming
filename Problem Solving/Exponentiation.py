# Exponentiation by squaring
# Say you want to calculate 2^32. Normally weâ€™d iterate 32 times and find the result. What if I told you it can be done in 5 iterations?

# Exponentiation by squaring or Binary exponentiation is a general method for fast computation of large positive integer powers of a number in O(log2N). Not only this, the method is also used for computation of powers of polynomials and square matrices.

# Application:

# Calculation of large powers of a number is mostly required in RSA encryption. RSA also uses modular arithmetic along with binary exponentiation.
