// Like merge sort, exploits the fact that arrays of 0 or 1 element are always sorted
// Works by selecting one element (called the "pivot") and finding the index where the pivot should end up in the sorted array
// Once the pivot is positioned appropriately, quick sort can be applied on either side of the pivot

// In order to implement quick sort, it's useful to first implement a function responsible arranging elements in an array on either side of a pivot
// Given an array, this helper function should designate an element as the pivot
// It should then rearrange elements in the array so that all values less than the pivot are moved to the left of the pivot, and all values greater than the pivot are moved to the right of the pivot
// The order of elements on either side of the pivot doesn't matter!
// The helper should do this in place, that is, it should not create a new array
// When complete, the helper should return the index of the pivot

// Picking a pivot
// The runtime of quick sort depends in part on how one selects the pivot
// Ideally, the pivot should be chosen so that it's roughly the median value in the data set you're sorting
// For simplicity, we'll always choose the pivot to be the first element 

// Pivot Pseudocode
// It will help to accept three arguments: an array, a start index, and an end index (these can default to 0 and the array length minus 1, respectively)
// Grab the pivot from the start of the array 
// Store the current pivot index in a variable (this will keep track of where the pivot should end up)
// Loop through the array from the start until the end
// If the pivot is greater than the current element, increment the pivot index variable and then swap the current element with the element at the pivot index
// Swap the starting element (i.e. the pivot) with the pivot index
// Return the pivot index

// Quicksort Pseudocode
// Call the pivot helper on the array
// When the helper returns to you the updated pivot index, recursively call the pivot helper on the subarray to the left of that index, and the subarray to the right of that index
// Your base case occurs when you consider a subarray with less than 2 elements

// Sorting Exercise - pivot helper
// In this exercise, your goal is to implement a function called pivot . This function contains nearly all of the logic you'll need in order to implement Quick Sort in the next exercise.

// The pivot  function is responsible for taking an array, setting the pivot value, and mutating the array so that all values less than the pivot wind up to the left of it, and all values greater than the pivot wind up to the right of it. It's also helpful if this helper returns the index of where the pivot value winds up.

// For example, if we decide the pivot will always be the first element in the array, it should behave in the following way:

var arr = [4, 2, 5, 3, 6];
pivot(arr); // 2
arr; // [3, 2, 4, 5, 6];
// In this code, the specifics of how the arr  variable gets mutated are not important. All that matters is that 4 winds up at index 2, with 3 and 2 to the left of it (in any order), and with 5 and 6 to the right of it (in any order).

// Hint: When we get to Quick Sort, it will be helpful for the pivot  helper to accept not only an array an an optional comparator, but also an optional start and end index. These should default to 0 and the array length minus 1, respectively. We've provided these to you in the starter code, but their utility may not be apparent yet. That's okay! When you get to implementing Quick Sort, their usefulness will become clearer.


var arr1 = [5, 4, 9, 10, 2, 20, 8, 7, 3];
var arr2 = [8, 4, 2, 5, 0, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16];
var arr3 = ["LilBub", "Garfield", "Heathcliff", "Blue", "Grumpy"];
 
function strLength(a, b) {
  return a.length - b.length
}
 
pivot(arr1); // 3
pivot(arr2); // 4
pivot(arr3, strLength); // 1
 
arr1.slice(0, 3).sort((a, b) => a - b); // [2, 3, 4]
arr1.slice(3).sort((a, b) => a - b); // [5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20]
 
arr2.slice(0, 4).sort((a, b) => a - b); // [0, 2, 4, 5]
arr2.slice(4).sort((a, b) => a - b); // [8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16]
 
arr3.slice(0, 1).sort(strLength); // ["Blue"]
arr3.slice(1).sort(strLength); // ["LilBub", "Grumpy", "Garfield", "Heathcliff"]
 

// The next sorting algorithm we'll consider is Quick Sort. Unfortunately, quicksort is not the most intuitive of algorithms and has a wide range of implementations. It may help to check out this great video from Computerphile for a quick introduction to how quicksort works:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE4VP_8Y0BU

// The algorithm is as follows:

// Pick an element in the array and designate it as the "pivot". While there are quite a few options for choosing the pivot. We'll make things simple to start, and will choose the pivot as the first element. This is not an ideal choice, but it makes the algorithm easier to understand for now.
// Next, compare every other element in the array to the pivot.
// If it's less than the pivot value, move it to the left of the pivot.
// If it's greater, move it to the right.
// Once you have finished comparing, the pivot will be in the right place.
// Next, recursively call quicksort again with the left and right halves from the pivot until the array is sorted.
// It's easiest to implement Quick Sort with the aid of your pivot  helper from the earlier exercise. This function is responsible for taking an array, setting the pivot value, and mutating the array so that all values less than the pivot wind up to the left of it, and all values greater than the pivot wind up to the right of it. It's also helpful if this helper returns the index of where the pivot value winds up.

// The default comparator you provide should assume that the two parameters are numbers and that we are sorting the values from smallest to largest.
