# Question
# A queen in a chessboard can be moved to any number of unoccupied squares in a straight line vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. The queen captures by occupying the square on which the opponent’s piece is located. You are given a chessboard of size   with  queens. Now, you are required to arrange all these  queens in such a way that no queen occupies the other queen. If you are required to solve this problem by using the backtracking technique from the data structures and algorithms, then determine the worst-case time complexity to perform this action in this scenario?
# O(N)
# O(1)
# O(log(N))
# O(N!)


# O(1) < O(n) < O(nlogn) < O(n*2)

# If we want to concatenate two linked lists which of the following gives O(1) complexity?
# 1) Singly linked lists 2) Doubly linked lists 3) Circular doubly linked lists

# Solution: Circular Doubly Linked Lists. This is because for singly and doubly linked lists, we need to traverse
# the first list till the end and append the second list. But in case of circular doubly linked lists we don’t have to traverse the lists

# In a linked list with 𝑛 nodes, the time taken to insert an element after an element pointed by
# some pointer is
#  (A) O(1) (B) O(𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑛) (C) O(𝑛) (D) O(𝑛1𝑜𝑔𝑛)
# Solution: A.


# In Data Structures, which of the following statements about the worst-case time complexity in performing various
# operations on the queue data structure are correct

# 1. If you are required to access an element in the queue of n elements, then the worst-case time complexity
# is 0(1).

# 2. If you are required to search an element in the queue of n elements, then the worst-case time complexity
# is O(n).

# 3. If you are required to insert an element in the queue of n elements, then the worst-case time complexity is
# 0(1).

# 4. If you are required to delete an element in the queue of n elements, then the worst-case time complexity
# is 0(1).
