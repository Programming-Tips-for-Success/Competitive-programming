# Analysis of Algorithms | Commonly used Rate of Growths
1. O(1) 
2. O(log2 n) 
3. O(n)
4. O(n log2 n)
5. O(n2square) 
6. (n2square log2 n)
7. O(n3cube)
8. O(2npower)
9. O(n!)

Which kind of growth best characterizes each of these functions?
(3/2)n power Exponential
1 Constant
(3/2)n Linear
2n3cube Polynomial
2npower Exponential
3n2square Polynomial
1000 Constant
3n Linear

T(n) = 2n2+3n+1 =0(n2)
Drop lower order terms
Drop all the constant multipliers

Running Time Complexity
in terms of Big-O O(f(n))
O(n!),O(cnpower),O(ncpower)-Worst
O(nlogn)-Bad 
O(n)-Fair 
O(logn)-Good 
O(1)-Best

O(1)<O(logn) <O(n) <O(nlogn) <0(ncpower) <0(n!)
