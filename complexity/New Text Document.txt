A queen in a chessboard can be moved to any number of unoccupied squares in a straight line vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. The queen captures by occupying the square on which the opponentâ€™s piece is located. You are given a chessboard of size   with  queens. Now, you are required to arrange all these  queens in such a way that no queen occupies the other queen. If you are required to solve this problem by using the backtracking technique from the data structures and algorithms, then determine the worst-case time complexity to perform this action in this scenario?
