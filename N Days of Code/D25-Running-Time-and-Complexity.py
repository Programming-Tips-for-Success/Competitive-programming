Objective
Today we're learning about running time! Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!
Task
A prime is a natural number greater than
that has no positive divisors other than and itself. Given a number, , determine and print whether it's or
.
Note: If possible, try to come up with a
primality algorithm, or see what sort of optimizations you come up with for an
algorithm. Be sure to check out the Editorial after submitting your code!
Input Format
The first line contains an integer,
, the number of test cases.
Each of the subsequent lines contains an integer,
, to be tested for primality.
Constraints
Output Format
For each test case, print whether
is or
on a new line.
Sample Input
3
12
5
7
Sample Output
Not prime
Prime
Prime
Explanation
Test Case 0:
.
is divisible by numbers other than and itself (i.e.: , , ), so we print
on a new line.
Test Case 1:
.
is only divisible and itself, so we print
on a new line.
Test Case 2:
.
is only divisible and itself, so we print on a new line.

# Question
# A queen in a chessboard can be moved to any number of unoccupied squares in a straight line vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. The queen captures by occupying the square on which the opponentâ€™s piece is located. You are given a chessboard of size   with  queens. Now, you are required to arrange all these  queens in such a way that no queen occupies the other queen. If you are required to solve this problem by using the backtracking technique from the data structures and algorithms, then determine the worst-case time complexity to perform this action in this scenario?
# O(N)
# O(1)
# O(log(N))
# O(N!)


# O(1) < O(n) < O(nlogn) < O(n*2)
