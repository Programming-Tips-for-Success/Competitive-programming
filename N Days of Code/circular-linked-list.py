# circular linked
# lists do not have ends While traversing the circular linked lists we should be careful otherwise we will be
# traversing the list infinitely. In circular linked lists each node has a successor.
# Note that unlike singly linked lists, there is no node with NULL pointer in a circularly linked list. In some
# situations, circular linked lists are useful. 
# applications-Circular linked lists are used in managing the computing resources of a computer. We can use circular lists for
# implementing stacks and queues

# program
# Counting Nodes in a Circular List
# Printing the contents of a circular list
# Inserting a Node at the End of a Circular Linked List
# Inserting a Node at Front of a Circular Linked List
# Deleting the Last Node in a Circular List
# Deleting the First Node in a Circular List
