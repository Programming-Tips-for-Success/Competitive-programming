# Topics to cover - The following operations make linked lists an ADT:
# Iterative & recursive approaches
# Doubly LinkedList, flattering linked list
# Implement Stack using Linked List

# You are given a pointer to the first element of a linked list 𝐿. There are two possibilities for 𝐿, it
# either ends (snake) or its last element points back to one of the earlier elements in the list (snail). Task is to
# devise an algorithm that tests whether a given list 𝐿 is a snake or a snail.

# Check whether the given linked list is either NULL-terminated or not. If there is a cycle find the start node of the loop.

# Insert a node in a sorted linked list

# Reverse a singly linked list

# How will you find the middle of the linked list?

#  How will you display a linked list from the end?

# Check whether the given Linked List length is even or odd?

# If the head of a linked list is pointing to 𝑘𝑡ℎ element, then how will you get the elements before 𝑘𝑡ℎ element

# Given two sorted Linked Lists, we need to merge them into the third list in sorted order. 

# Reverse the linked list in pairs. If you have a linked list that holds 1→2→3→4→𝑋, then after the function has been called the linked list would hold 2→1→4→3→X

# Given a binary tree convert it to doubly linked list.

# How do we sort the Linked Lists?

# Split a Circular Linked List into two equal parts. If the number of nodes in the list are odd then
# make first list one node extra than second list.

# How will you check if the linked list is palindrome or not?

# Exchange the adjacent elements in a link list.

# For a given 𝐾 value (𝐾 > 0) reverse blocks of 𝐾 nodes in a list.
# Example: Input: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10, 
# Output for different 𝐾 values:
# For 𝐾 = 2: 2 1 4 3 6 5 8 7 10 9, For 𝐾 = 3: 3 2 1 6 5 4 9 8 7 10, For 𝐾 = 4: 4 3 2 1 8 7 6 5 9 10

# JosephusCircle: 𝑁 people have decided to elect a leader by arranging themselves in a circle
# and eliminating every 𝑀𝑡ℎ person around the circle, closing ranks as each person drops out. Find which
# person will be the last one remaining (with rank 1)

# Find modular node: Given a singly linked list, write a function to find the last element from the
# beginning whose 𝑛%𝑘 == 0, where 𝑛 is the number of elements in the list and 𝑘 is an integer constant. For
# example, if 𝑛 = 19 and 𝑘 = 3 then we should return 18𝑡ℎnode

# Find modular node from end: Given a singly linked list, write a function to find the first
# element from the end whose 𝑛%𝑘 == 0, where 𝑛 is the number of elements in the list and 𝑘 is an integer
# constant. For example, if 𝑛 = 19 and 𝑘 = 3 then we should return 16𝑡ℎnode.

# Find fractional node: Given a singly linked list, write a function to find the 𝑛/𝑘 𝑡ℎ element, where
# 𝑛 is the number of elements in the list.

# Median in an infinite series of integers- 
# : Median is the middle number in a sorted list of numbers (if we have odd number of elements). If we
# have even number of elements, median is the average of two middle numbers in a sorted list of numbers.
# We can solve this problem with linked lists (with both sorted and unsorted linked lists)


# Given a singly linked list L: 𝐿1-> 𝐿2-> 𝐿3…-> 𝐿𝑛−1-> 𝐿𝑛, reorder it to: 𝐿1-> 𝐿𝑛-> 𝐿2-> 𝐿𝑛−1……
#  We divide the list in two parts for instance 1->2->3->4->5 will become 1->2->3 and 4->5, we have to
# reverse the second list and give a list that alternates both


# Which sorting algorithm is easily adaptable to singly linked lists?
# Solution: Simple Insertion sort is easily adabtable to singly linked list. To insert the an element, the linked list
# is traversed until the proper position is found, or until the end of the list is reached. It be inserted into the list
# by merely adjusting the pointers without shifting any elements unlike in the array. This reduces the time
# required for insertion but not the time required for searching for the proper position

# How do you implement insertion sort for linked lists?

# Given a list, rotate the list to the right by k places, where k is non-negative. For example: Given
# 1->2->3->4->5->NULL and k = 2, return 4->5->1->2->3->NULL.

# You are given two linked lists representing two non-negative numbers. The digits are stored in
# reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked
# list. For example with input: (3 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4); the output should be 8 -> 0 -> 8.

# Given a linked list and a value K, partition it such that all nodes less than K come before nodes
# greater than or equal to K. You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two
# partitions. For example, given 1->4->3->2->5->2 and K = 3, return 1->2->2->4->3->5.

# Merge k sorted linked lists and return it as one sorted list.
# you can use priority queue here

# Given a unordered linked list, how do you remove duplicates in it?


# Reverse the second half of a linked list 

# remove duplicates from an unsorted singly linked list.
# Write a program that returns the middle node of an unsorted linked list.
# Given an unsorted singly linked list and an integer index, write a program that outputs the value of the node at the designated 
# index position. 
# Given a singly linked list, write a program the shifts every node kk unit to the left.
# For example
# When 4\rightarrow→6\rightarrow→8\rightarrow→9 is shifted 2 units left it becomes 8\rightarrow→9\rightarrow→4\rightarrow→6
# Given a sorted circular linked list of Nodes that store integers and a new Node, insert the new Node into the correct position.
# For example, 2 is a prime that is 1 more than the perfect square 1.
# design the data structures for Zomato cuisines adding and removing system, different ways of designing approaches.

# Deleting the Last node in Singly Linked List
# Deleting Singly Linked List

# Linked List: find length and middle, search in singly linked list, reverse linked list

# Clone a linked list with next and random pointer

# Serialise and Deserialise a linked list with next and random pointer.

# How will you implement a linked list with 1 million nodes? How will you access 999999 th node? Give some optimal design strategy and implementation.

# Reversal of Linked List in groups of K.

# Given two linked lists both represent a number. Create a linked list that contains its sum.
# Find 𝑛𝑡ℎ node from the end of the list
