Jadoo hates numbers, but he requires to print a special number "420" to recharge the equation of life. He asks your help to print the number but Since he hates numbers, he asks you to write the program such that there would not be any number in the code.  

We can achieve this by using ASCII value. 
'''

print(ord('d')+ord('d')+ord('d')+ord('x'))  

# convert from character to  integer ord
# ord method used to find ASCII value. here we use d and x which has 100 and 120 value.

# integer to character chr
print(chr(ord('A')))  # A

print((ord('A')))  # 65
