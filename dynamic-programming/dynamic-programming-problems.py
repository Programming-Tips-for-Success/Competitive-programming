# Dynamic Programming/Algorithm- 
# Dynamic programming is all about ordering your computations in a way that avoids recalculating duplicate work. You have a main problem (the root of your tree of subproblems), and subproblems (subtrees). The subproblems typically repeat and overlap.
# Optimization over recursion.
# Reduce the complexity.

# Examples-

# overlapping subproblem

# optimal substructure

# Fibonacci problem 

# Rod Cutting Problem, 
# Knapsack Problem, 
# Matrix Chain Multiplication

# Top-Down vs Bottom-Up Dynamic Programming.

# Dynamic Programming application
# Duckworth-Lewis method in cricket.
