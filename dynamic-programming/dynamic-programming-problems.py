# Dynamic Programming/Algorithm- 
# Dynamic programming is all about ordering your computations in a way that avoids recalculating duplicate work. You have a main problem (the root of your tree of subproblems), and subproblems (subtrees). The subproblems typically repeat and overlap.
# Optimization over recursion.
# Reduce the complexity.

# overlapping subproblem-
#  Dynamic Programming is not useful when there are no common (overlapping) subproblems because there is no point storing the solutions if they are not needed again. 
# example binary search - DP solution not possible

# Top-Down vs Bottom-Up Dynamic Programming.
#  two different ways to store the values so that these values can be reused:
# a) Memoization (Top Down)
# b) Tabulation (Bottom Up)

# optimal substructure

# Examples-
# Fibonacci problem 

# Rod Cutting Problem, 
# Knapsack Problem, 
# Matrix Chain Multiplication



# Dynamic Programming application
# Duckworth-Lewis method in cricket.
