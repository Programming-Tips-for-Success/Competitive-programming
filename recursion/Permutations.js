//  we were to generate a permutation, then we would need to pick characters for each "slot:' Suppose we 
// had 7 characters in the string. In the first slot, we have 7 choices. Once we pick the letter there, we have 6 
// choices for the next slot. (Note that this is 6 choices for each of the 7 choices earlier.) Then 5 choices for the 
// next slot, and so on. 
// Therefore, the total number of options is 7 * x6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1, which is also expressed as 7! (7 factorial). 
// This tells us that there are n! permutations. Therefore, permutation is called n! times in its base case 
// (when prefix is the full permutation).
