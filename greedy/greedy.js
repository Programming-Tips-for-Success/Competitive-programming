// A greedy algorithm is an algorithmic paradigm that follows the problem solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum.

// WHERE ARE THEY USED?
// Remember how Dijkstra's Algorithm works!

// PSEUDOCODE FOR COIN CHANGE
// Start with the largest denomination
// Once the total can not use the largest
// Move to the 2nd largest
// Work your way down until there is no more change
