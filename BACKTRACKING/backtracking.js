// Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to notably constraint satisfaction problems  

// It incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons a candidate ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution"

// basically Going through a solution and retracing steps backward if the solution is not valid.

// whERE IS IT USED?
// Puzzle Solving - Sudoku

// N Queens / Rooks
