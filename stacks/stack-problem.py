# In data structures, a stack initially holds only one element: {2}. What will be the size of the stack after performing the following operations for ten times:

# Stacks/Queues: sort values in stack, implement two stacks using one array

# Design a stack which holds an integer value such that getMinimum() function should return the minimum element in the stack. Implement popMin() function which would pop the minimum element from the original stack.
