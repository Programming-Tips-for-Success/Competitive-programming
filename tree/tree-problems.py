# topics to cover
# Binary Search Tree, N-ary Tree
# Given a n-ary tree. zigzag level order traversal.
# Print BT from Different View
# Conversion of BT, Post-Order, InOrder, PreOrder Operations
# Mirror Operations, Leaf Nodes Distances,Lowest Common Ansesters/ancestor
# Recursive and Iterative Operations

# Note : Un-important topic in Tree is B* Tree, Red Black Tree,AVL tree, Segment Tree

# interviewers indirectly ask this
# “given a binary tree.” Other times it’s implicit, like “we want to track the number of books associated with each author.”''

# Traversing a Tree without Recursion and without a stack (Morris Traversal)
# Traversing a Binary Tree


# Segment Tree
# Segment Tree (with lazy propagation)
# Persistent Segment Tree
# Lazy segment tree 

# tree- DLL interconversion

# Save all leaf nodes of a Binary tree in a Doubly Linked List by using Right node as Next node and Left Node as Previous Node.

# Find all nodes at k-distance from a given node in a binary tree

# Construct a binary tree from given inorder and preorder traversals.

# Return a tree such that each internal node stores the sum of all its child nodes. Each leaf node stores zero.

# Check whether a given binary tree is balanced or not. Definition was no two leaves should have height differences of greater than one.

# Connect nodes on the same level in a binary tree.
# Find the sum of data of all leaves of a binary tree on the same level and then multiply sums obtained of all levels.


# Least common ancestor of two nodes in a binary tree

# Given the root to a binary tree, a value n and k.Find the sum of nodes at distance k from node with value n


# Given a binary search tree , print the path which has the sum equal to k and has minimum hops. i.e if there are multiple paths with the sum equal to k then print the path with minimum number of nodes.
#
# Write a program to connect the next left node in a binary tree. Also the first node of each level should be pointing to the last node of the next level? (Without using Queue)
# Convert a binary tree to its sum tree(each node is the sum of its children) 

# Given a tree with edge weights, find any path in the tree with maximum sum of edges.

#  KD-tree 
#  Splay tree
