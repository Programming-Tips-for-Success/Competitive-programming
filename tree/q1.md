In Data Structures and Algorithms, you are given an undirected graph and an integer m. Now, you are required to determine if the graph can be colored with at most m colors such that no two adjacent vertices of the graph are colored with the same color. If you are implementing Breadth-First Search (BFS) traversing technique to perform this action, then which of the following sequences of steps in this scenario are correct:
1. For each vertex connected to our node via an edge, check if the color of the nodes is the same. If they are the same, then increase the color of the other node (not the current) by one.
2. For each vertex connected to our node via an edge, check if the node is visited or unvisited. If not visited, mark it as visited and push it in a queue.
3. Check all edges of the given node.
4. Check condition for maxColors. If it exceeds m, then return false.
5. After visiting all nodes, return true.

2-3 ->1-> 4 -> 5
3 ->1-2 -> 4 -> 5
