<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arya is attempting to solve a math problem. In this problem, she is given a tree with N nodes, indexed from 1 to N where the root node is indexed as 1. Each node of the tree has a defined value. She wants to trace a path from one leaf to another leaf in such a way that will award her the maximum score for that path. The score of a path is defined as the product of node values along the path.<br>
<br>
Write an algorithm to find the&nbsp;maximum possible score.</span></p>


<br>

<p><strong>Input</strong><br>
The first line of the input consists of an integer -&nbsp;<em>num</em>, representing the number of nodes in the tree (N).<br>
The&nbsp;second line consists N<em> </em>space-separated integers representing the value of each node in the tree.<br>
The third line consists of two space-separated integers - <em>numEdges </em>and <em>numNodes</em>, representing the number of edges (E) and the number of nodes forming an edge (where V = 2 always), respectively.<br>
The next E lines consist of two space-separated integers - <em>start&nbsp;</em>and <em>end</em><em>,</em> representing the indices of the starting node and ending node of an edge of the tree.<br>
<br>
<strong>Output</strong><br>
Print an integer representing the maximum possible score.<br>
<br>
<strong>Constraints</strong><br>
1 ≤ <em>num</em> ≤ 10<sup>3</sup><br>
-10<sup>3&nbsp;</sup>≤ val&nbsp;≤ 10<sup>3&nbsp;</sup>; where val&nbsp;is the value of a node<br>
<em>numEdges </em>=&nbsp;<em>num-1<br>
numNodes = 2</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Example</strong><br>
Input:<br>
4<br>
-1 2 3 2<br>
3 2<br>
1 2<br>
1 3<br>
3 4<br>
<br>
Output:<br>
-12<br>
<br>
Explanation:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1(-1)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\<br>
2(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3(3)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4(2)<br>
<br>
There is only one route from leaf 2 to leaf 4, as there are only 2 leaves.<br>
(2)-&gt;(1) : Score = 2 *-1= -2<br>
(2)-&gt;(1)-&gt;(3): Score = -2 * 3 = -6<br>
(2)-&gt;(1)-&gt;(3)-&gt;(4):Score = -6*2 = -12<br>
So&nbsp;best possible answer&nbsp;is -12.</p>
